## My process

### Built with

* Semantic **HTML5** markup
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox** for centering and layout
* **Mobile-first workflow**

---

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **flexbox alignment, padding vs margin, and card-style layouts**.

For example, I learned how to perfectly center a card on the screen using flex:

```css
body {
  background-color: #D5E1EF;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 0;
}
```

I also practiced applying **border-radius** to both the card and the QR image container:

```css
.qr-component {
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Improve my **grid layout** skills (for more complex designs).
* Explore **responsive typography** and spacing systems.
* Practice creating **reusable design systems** (colors, spacing, typography).

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) – Super useful for understanding alignment.
* [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) – Great source for real-world projects.
