## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component Solution

* Live Site URL: [Your Live Demo](https://your-live-demo-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic **HTML5** markup
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox** for centering and layout
* **Mobile-first workflow**

---

### What I learned

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of **flexbox alignment, padding vs margin, and card-style layouts**.

For example, I learned how to perfectly center a card on the screen using flex:

```css
body {
  background-color: #D5E1EF;
  min-height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 0;
}
```

I also practiced applying **border-radius** to both the card and the QR image container:

```css
.qr-component {
  border-radius: 10px;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

---

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Improve my **grid layout** skills (for more complex designs).
* Explore **responsive typography** and spacing systems.
* Practice creating **reusable design systems** (colors, spacing, typography).

---

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) – Super useful for understanding alignment.
* [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) – Great source for real-world projects.

## Acknowledgments

Big thanks to **Frontend Mentor** for providing this project and helping me improve step by step.

👉 Do you want me to also include the **exact design system** (colors, typography, spacing variables) inside the README, so you can show recruiters that you worked with a system like in Figma?
